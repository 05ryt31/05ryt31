<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ryuto</h1>

<h3 align="center">A Little Bit About Me 👤</h2>

I was born in **Shiga**, Japan, near Osaka. When I was in middle school, the iPhone completely changed how I viewed technology.  
**I was fascinated by how a single product could influence millions of people’s daily lives.** That was the moment I began to dream of building something that could impact people at scale.

Years later, I dedicated myself to entering one of Japan’s top universities for computer science. I studied **more than ten hours** a day for a year, confident that I would succeed.   
When I checked my results on my phone, I saw one word: **"Failed"**. I had missed admission by just **"ten points"**.

> That moment became a turning point.

Instead of repeating the same path, I asked myself a harder question:  
<br>
*If I truly want to work in a cutting-edge environment and build meaningful technology, am I willing to step outside my comfort zone?*  

**I chose the harder path.**

With no experience living abroad and limited confidence in my English, I made the decision to move to the United States and pursue computer science from the ground up. I chose to start at a community college in California as my first step toward a bigger goal — building technology that improves lives on a global scale.

Today, I focus on building scalable full-stack systems and exploring cloud infrastructure because I want to understand not just how products look — but how they work at scale.

#### I am still on that journey
